### Offensive Security & Vulnerability Research

* **Hack The Box Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (HTB CPTS)** â€“ trained in full-scope adversarial assessment methodologies. [HTB Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-penetration-testing-specialist)
* **Web-application exploitation** â€“ experienced in finding and exploiting injection flaws, authentication weaknesses, logic errors and misconfigurations during bug-bounties.

  * Command-injection discovery and post-exploitation workflow.
  * Local File Inclusion / directory traversal and buffer-overflow proof-of-concept development. [Fortinet](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/buffer-overflow)
* **Zero-day research & exploit authoring** â€“ design custom fuzzers, triage crashes into root-cause flaws, build reliable exploits that slip past modern mitigations (ASLR, DEP, stack canaries), and steer the whole coordinated-disclosure cycle through patch diffing and proof-of-fix validation. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_vulnerability)

### Network-Layer & Wireless Attack Techniques
