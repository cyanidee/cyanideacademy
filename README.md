Example of me (**Cyanide/H3ll0k1tty**) getting databse accesss doing SqlMAP INJECTIONZZZ in Base64 Encoding (u can use my theory below to do this as well lolz lolz lolz)
{% endembed %}

**200 IQ custom** theory that slay asf (legit if you can't bypass with this method then there is 0% SQL injection anywayz)

So complex theory as you can see in the picture below this is about logical gates and how the CPU works deep down but im going to be quick and tell you that this is bascially 0s and 1s.. but the reason this is so OP for sqlmap is because everything in the whole PC is made of 0s and 1s thanks to alan turing theory we can create anything thats turing-passable with in binary.

So here is the next slay step...  which is the OP method as we can see **ChatGPT** has verified my theory, we can use the and the "AND" logical gates combined with the "Inverted" logical gate, (**we dont** even need "OR" gate)&#x20;

For example look at this **SQL injection code uwu**

```
(SLEEP(10-(IF(16=16,0,10))))
```

If we look closely we can see that and IF statement is being used we can make the same functionality with my 200 iq method by using logical gates, this is basically the same as the statement above and will bypass every WAF or firewall, if it doesn't you can try with SQLmap --tampers to url encode or use pure parantheses to not include spaces in the URL: \


```
(SELECT(SLEEP(10 - ((NOT(NOT(16=16)) AND 0) AND (NOT(TRUE) AND 10)))))
```

\


so my pro sophisticated method is as pure as a computer can come because of logical.. making it almost impossible for firewalls or other security to detect the attempts.&#x20;

By using logical operations ('AND', 'NOT') we can make the most stealthy and most "bypassable" method for SQL injection attacks.





H3ll0K1tty aka CYANIDE on TOP BTW too smart for this shiiii
